# Commands

The registered command is `/lootchest`; `/lc` is its short alias. Subcommands use
the matching `lootchest.<subcommand>` permission. `/lc info` is public; all other
permissions default to server operators unless explicitly granted.

## Editor Workflow

`/lc create` and `/lc edit` expose menus for contents, item chances, respawn time,
container type, particle, copying, and per-box message toggles. Text supplied
to `/lc setholo` accepts MiniMessage colors such as `<gold>` and hex colors such as
`<#f9e2af>`.

Command names and internal chest names are tab-completed when the sender has the
corresponding permission.
